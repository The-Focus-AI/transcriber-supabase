**Current Focus:** Workflow Orchestration - Test Suite Evaluation

**Overview:**
The `workflow-orchestrator` function's main entry point (`index.ts`) was refactored to use the extracted logic in `orchestrator.ts`. The test suite was run to assess the health of the functions after recent changes and refactoring.

**Current State:**
- The `workflow-orchestrator/index.ts` refactor is complete.
- Test Results:
  - `execute-echo`: Ignored (server not running).
  - `get-job`, `list-jobs`, `start-workflow`: Passing (with mock errors logged).
  - `workflow-orchestrator/jobFetcher`: Passing.
  - `workflow-orchestrator/jobProcessor`: **FAILING** (2 tests failed due to assertion errors - problem appears to be with mock workflow definition fetching).

**What's Next?**
- Fixing the `jobProcessor.test.ts` failures is currently **DEFERRED**.
- Awaiting user direction for the next task.

**Blockers:**
- None.

**Decisions:**
- Deferred fixing `jobProcessor.test.ts` failures.

## Current Task

- [X] **Iteration 7: Simple "Echo" Transformer & Executor**
    - Completed the `execute-echo` Edge Function.
    - Verified functionality with successful test runs.
    - Updated the `transformers` table with `echo-transformer` entry.

## Next Steps

- Proceed to Iteration 8: Data Flow Implementation.

## Blockers

- **[!] Unit tests for Iteration 6 (`workflow-orchestrator/index.test.ts`) require manual fixing due to unresolved type errors in mocks.**

## Decisions

- Completed Iteration 7 successfully. Ready to move on to the next iteration.

## Current Focus

- **Task**: Integrate `jsonpath-plus` for JSONPath operations.
- **Status**: Planned
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Install `jsonpath-plus`.
  2. Update modules to use `jsonpath-plus`.
  3. Test and document the integration.

## Created missing memory files: `progress.md`, `

- **Current Stage:** Testing `workflow-orchestrator` in production.
- **Next Steps:** Execute the function in production and monitor logs.
- **Blockers:** None identified.
- **Decisions:** Proceed with production testing to validate functionality.
