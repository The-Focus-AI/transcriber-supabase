## Overview

Completed the *implementation* for Iteration 6 (Step Execution Logic). The `workflow-orchestrator` function now identifies running jobs, finds the appropriate transformer and target function based on the current step, and invokes the target function. It also retains the logic to start pending jobs.

**Testing Status:** The unit tests (`index.test.ts`) for the orchestrator were updated but encountered persistent type errors related to the mocking strategy (`deno/std/testing/mock@0.177.0`). These tests need manual review and correction.

Ready to start Iteration 7: Simple "Echo" Transformer & Executor.

## Current Task

- [X] **Iteration 7: Simple "Echo" Transformer & Executor**
    - Completed the `execute-echo` Edge Function.
    - Verified functionality with successful test runs.
    - Updated the `transformers` table with `echo-transformer` entry.

## Next Steps

- Proceed to Iteration 8: Data Flow Implementation.

## Blockers

- **[!] Unit tests for Iteration 6 (`workflow-orchestrator/index.test.ts`) require manual fixing due to unresolved type errors in mocks.**

## Decisions

- Completed Iteration 7 successfully. Ready to move on to the next iteration.
