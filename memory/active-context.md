## Overview

Completed the *implementation* for Iteration 7 (Simple "Echo" Transformer & Executor). The `execute-echo` function was successfully tested and verified.

**Testing Status:** The unit tests (`index.test.ts`) for the orchestrator were updated but encountered persistent type errors related to the mocking strategy (`deno/std/testing/mock@0.177.0`). These tests need manual review and correction.

Ready to start Iteration 8: Data Flow Implementation.

## Current Task

- [X] **Iteration 7: Simple "Echo" Transformer & Executor**
    - Completed the `execute-echo` Edge Function.
    - Verified functionality with successful test runs.
    - Updated the `transformers` table with `echo-transformer` entry.

## Next Steps

- Proceed to Iteration 8: Data Flow Implementation.

## Blockers

- **[!] Unit tests for Iteration 6 (`workflow-orchestrator/index.test.ts`) require manual fixing due to unresolved type errors in mocks.**

## Decisions

- Completed Iteration 7 successfully. Ready to move on to the next iteration.
