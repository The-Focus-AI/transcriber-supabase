**Title:** Iteration 7: Simple "Echo" Transformer & Executor (In Progress)

**Summary:** Started work on the seventh iteration. Created the `execute-echo` Edge Function and its basic unit tests. Added the `echo-transformer` entry to the `transformers` table.

**Accomplishments:**
*   Created `execute-echo` Edge Function (`supabase/functions/execute-echo/index.ts`).
*   Implemented logic to handle POST requests, echoing the payload back in the response.
*   Created basic unit tests for `execute-echo` (`supabase/functions/execute-echo/index.test.ts`).
*   Provided SQL statement to insert `echo-transformer` into the `transformers` table.

**Decisions:**
*   Proceeding with Iteration 7 despite test issues in Iteration 6 to maintain momentum. Testing for Iteration 6 will need to be revisited.

**Blockers:**
*   Unit tests for Iteration 6 (`workflow-orchestrator/index.test.ts`) have unresolved type errors related to mocking, requiring manual investigation/fixing.

**Title:** Iteration 6: Step Execution Logic (Implementation Complete, Tests Blocked)

**Summary:** Implemented the core logic for step execution within the `workflow-orchestrator`. The orchestrator now identifies running jobs, retrieves workflow and transformer details, and invokes the correct target Edge Function. Unit tests were updated but are currently blocked by persistent type errors related to the mocking library.

**Accomplishments:**
*   Created shared type definitions in `supabase/functions/shared/types.ts`.
*   Modified `workflow-orchestrator` to handle `running` jobs:
    *   Fetches workflow definition based on `job.workflow_id`.
    *   Identifies the current step configuration using `job.current_step_id`.
    *   Fetches the transformer details (including `target_function`) based on `step.transformer_id`.
    *   Invokes the `target_function` using `supabaseClient.functions.invoke()` with a basic payload.
    *   Updates `job.last_updated_at` after invocation attempt.
    *   Retained logic to start `pending` jobs.
*   Attempted multiple refactors of the unit tests in `workflow-orchestrator/index.test.ts` using simplified mocking strategies.

**Decisions:**
*   Marked Iteration 6 as `[?]` (Needs Review) in `progress.md` due to testing issues.
*   Acknowledged testing blockers in `active-context.md`.
*   Decided to proceed to Iteration 7 to avoid being blocked by the test issues, with the plan to revisit Iteration 6 tests later.

**Blockers:**
*   Unit tests for `workflow-orchestrator` (`index.test.ts`) have unresolved type errors related to mocking (`deno/std/testing/mock@0.177.0`), requiring manual investigation/fixing.

**Title:** Complete Iteration 5: Basic Orchestrator Logic (Pickup Pending)

**Summary:** Finished the fifth iteration. Created the initial `workflow-orchestrator` Edge Function capable of finding pending jobs, marking them as 'running', and setting the initial step based on the workflow definition. Added necessary schema changes and unit tests.

**Accomplishments:**
*   Created and applied SQL migration `20250408194224_add_job_start_step.sql` to add `started_at` and `current_step_id` columns to the `jobs` table.
*   Added `createSupabaseServiceClient` to `shared/supabase-client.ts` for using the service role key.
*   Created the `workflow-orchestrator` Edge Function (`supabase/functions/workflow-orchestrator/index.ts`) with logic to fetch pending jobs, retrieve workflow definitions, and update job status to 'running' with the correct `current_step_id`.
*   Implemented basic unit tests for the orchestrator (`supabase/functions/workflow-orchestrator/index.test.ts`) using a simplified mocking strategy.
*   Provided instructions for manual invocation using Supabase CLI or cURL with an `ORCHESTRATOR_SECRET`.
*   Updated `progress.md` and `active-context.md`.

**Decisions:**
*   Used the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for the orchestrator to bypass RLS.
*   Added an `ORCHESTRATOR_SECRET` check for manual HTTP invocation security.
*   Simplified the mocking approach for unit tests after encountering difficulties with deeply nested mocks.
*   Proceeding to Iteration 6.

**Title:** Complete Iteration 4: Define Workflow Structure & Transformer Table

**Summary:** Finished the fourth iteration. The database schema now supports workflow definitions (`workflows.definition`) and reusable transformer configurations (`transformers` table).

**Accomplishments:**
*   Created and applied SQL migration for `workflows.definition` and the `transformers` table.
*   Provided example JSON for workflow definition and SQL for inserting a transformer.
*   Updated memory files.

**Decisions:**
*   Added `workflows.definition` as nullable initially to avoid potential issues with existing rows, deferring the `NOT NULL` constraint.
*   Proceeding to Iteration 5.
